2020 FRC Code onboarding guide.

Welcome to the 2020 season! If you have participated in the 2019 Season or the 2020 beta it is very important you delete all the previous instances of WPILib and any 3rd party vendor libraries.

You can find uninstall instructions here:
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html#uninstall-instructions


Then follow the instructions on the following guide to install WPILib and VSCode. Make sure to follow the instructions for your operating system!
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html#wpilib-installation-guide

A List of some of our 3rd Party Libraries can be found at:
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/wpilib-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html
This list is not comprehensive! At the bare minimum you will need to install the CTRE Phoenix, Rev SPARK MAX, Rev Color V3 and Analog Devices ADIS16448 libraries.
